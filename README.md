# Description of the assignment
This is an music visualiser which is used to display music in the form of unique entities. This entities are
interact with the music while it is playing.

# Instructions
Fork the Project and clone into your local computer
Press F5 to run the program
Play the music and watch the shape transform
Press the spacebar to start the music or stop it
Each entity connect on the keypad from 0 to 9. They are either in a on and off state.
Turn each of the entities on and off
There are a couple of entities I have designed to visualise the music
Watch them interact with the music
Sit back and relax

# How it works
- The music is played 
- Each note of the music is assigned a value by the minim library
- The values are what is used to interact with the music
- Each entity is drawn on the screen every frame

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
- Creating more complex shapes from easier shapes. I managed to create a more complex looking amplitude wave from the sin wave.
- I manage an awesome cube display called cube part which is one of the highlights of my project.
- I made a good attempt at learning PVectors from creating the Orbit part
